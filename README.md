# Prompt Inspector üîé

Inspect prompts üîé from images uploaded to Discord. This is a fork of the original [PromptInspectorBot](https://github.com/sALTaccount/PromptInspectorBot), enhanced with more powerful features and a streamlined setup.

## What it does

This Discord bot automatically detects and displays AI image generation metadata from various sources. It can read metadata from PNG files and, with the new **Describe** feature, can even generate descriptions for JPEGs and other images that have had their metadata stripped by Discord.

## Features

*   **Comprehensive Metadata Parsing:** Powered by an enhanced version of the Dataset-Tools metadata engine, the bot supports over 200 ComfyUI node types, including FLUX, PixArt, and more.
*   **Multiple Interaction Styles:** Use emoji reactions (üîé), slash commands (`/metadata`), or right-click context menus ("View Prompt") to inspect images.
*   **PluralKit Support:** Automatically resolves proxied messages to the real user, ensuring a seamless experience for users of PluralKit.
*   **Manual Metadata Entry:** For images like JPEGs or screenshots, you can manually add the prompt and other details.
*   **Lightweight and Server-Friendly:** The bot runs the metadata parser in a separate process, keeping its memory usage low and making it suitable for free-tier hosting services.

### Experimental Features

*   **‚ú® Describe Feature:** Uses the Gemini API to generate descriptions for images without metadata. You can choose between Danbooru-style tags or a natural language description.
*   **üó£Ô∏è Ask/Discuss Feature:** A conversational AI feature that allows you to have a guided conversation with the Gemini API.
*   **üé® Dream/Imagine/Generate Feature:** An image generation feature that uses different style prompts to guide the Gemini API in creating images.

## How to use

1.  **Post an image** in a monitored channel.
2.  **React with üîé:** If the bot finds metadata, it will add a üîé reaction. Click it to see the metadata.
3.  **Use Slash Commands:**
    *   `/metadata <image>`: Get a private metadata report for an image.
    *   `/ask <question>`: Ask a question to the conversational AI.
    *   `/dream <prompt> <style>`: Generate an image with a specific style.
4.  **Use the Context Menu:** Right-click on a message with an image and select "View Prompt".
5.  **Describe an Image:** After getting a metadata report, click the "Describe" button to generate a description using the Gemini API.

## Setup

You can run the bot locally or deploy it to a hosting service like Railway.

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/PromptInspectorBot.git
    cd PromptInspectorBot
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Create a Discord Bot:**
    *   Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
    *   Go to the "Bot" tab and add a bot.
    *   Enable the `Message Content Intent` and `Server Members Intent`.
5.  **Configure the bot:** See the **Configuration** section below.
6.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python3 bot_enhanced.py
    ```

### Deployment with Docker (Recommended)

Using Docker is the recommended way to deploy the bot, as it ensures the environment is consistent and handles all dependencies automatically.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t prompt-inspector-bot .
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --env-file .env prompt-inspector-bot
    ```

#### Deploying to Railway

Railway makes it easy to deploy the bot directly from your GitHub repository.

1.  **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new project** on Railway and link it to your forked repository.
3.  **Add your secrets** as environment variables in the Railway project settings (see **Configuration** below).
4.  Railway will automatically build the `Dockerfile` and deploy the bot.

## Configuration

You'll need to configure the bot using environment variables. You can set these directly on your hosting service or create a `.env` file in the project root for local development.

**Important:** It is strongly recommended to use your hosting provider's secrets management system (usually called "Environment Variables" or "Secrets") to store your `BOT_TOKEN` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`. The `.env` file is for local development only and should **never** be committed to your repository.

*   `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token. (Required)
*   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google AI Studio API key for the "Describe" feature. (Required for the describe feature)
*   `ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS`: A comma-separated list of server IDs where the bot is allowed to run. Leave empty to allow all servers.
*   `MONITORED_CHANNEL_IDS`: A comma-separated list of channel IDs where the bot should automatically scan for images. Leave empty to monitor all channels.
*   `CHANNEL_FEATURES`: A semicolon-separated list of channel-specific feature configurations. For example: `123456789012345678:metadata,describe;098765432109876543:ask,dream`

You can also customize the bot's behavior by copying `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and editing the values.

### API Keys

*   **Civitai API Key:** While optional, a Civitai API key is recommended for fetching detailed metadata about models and LoRAs. You can get a free API key from your [Civitai User Account Settings](https://civitai.com/user/account).
*   **Gemini API Key:** To use the experimental "Describe", "Ask", and "Dream" features, you'll need a Gemini API key. You can get one for free from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Permissions

For the bot to function correctly, it needs the following permissions in your Discord server:

*   **Read Messages/View Channel:** To see messages and images in channels.
*   **Send Messages:** To send metadata replies.
*   **Read Message History:** To fetch the original message when a reaction is added.
*   **Add Reactions:** To add the üîé and ‚õî reactions to messages.
*   **Use External Emojis:** If you are using custom emojis for the reactions.
*   **Attach Files:** To send metadata as a file if it's too long.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Bot is not responding:**
    *   Check if the bot is online in your server.
    *   Make sure the bot has the necessary permissions in the channel (see **Permissions** section).
    *   Check the bot's logs for any error messages.
*   **"Describe" feature is not working:**
    *   Ensure you have a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file or environment variables.
    *   Check the bot's logs for any API errors from Google.
*   **Images are not being processed:**
    *   Make sure the image is a `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` file.
    *   Check if the image size is within the `SCAN_LIMIT_BYTES` limit defined in your `config.toml`.
    *   Ensure the channel is in the `MONITORED_CHANNEL_IDS` list in your `config.toml` (if you are using the emoji reaction feature).
