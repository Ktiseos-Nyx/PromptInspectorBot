# Prompt Inspector ðŸ”Ž
Inspect prompts ðŸ”Ž from images uploaded to discord

## Functionality

This Discord bot reacts to any image with generation metadata from Automatic1111's WebUI and ComfyUI.
If generation metadata is detected, a magnifying glass react is added to the image. If the user
clicks the magnifying glass, they are sent a DM with the image generation information.

Two context menu apps are provided.
One sends an ephemeral response in the channel.
The other activates the emoji reaction (ðŸ”Ž) DM based response (useful for channels the bot isn't watching).
