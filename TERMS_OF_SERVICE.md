### 4.2 Accuracy

### 4.4 Third-Party Services
- The Bot may use third-party services (like CivitAI's API for model lookups)
- We're not responsible for those services
- If CivitAI is down, the Bot's model lookup features won't work. Not our fault.

## The Actually Important Part

**Look, here's the deal:**

This is a free, open-source utility bot for AI artists. It reads metadata from images and shows it to you. That's it.

- We're not making money off this
- We're not storing your data
- We're not doing anything sketchy
- We're just trying to make a useful tool

If you use the Bot responsibly, we won't have any problems. If you abuse it, we'll block you. If something breaks, we'll try to fix it, but no promises.

**Use common sense. Be nice. Don't sue us.**

That's the whole philosophy. The legal stuff above is just covering our bases.

---

**Remember:** These Terms exist to protect both you and us. Read them, understand them, and if you have questions, ask. üíú

*This Terms of Service was written by humans (and Claude), for humans. If you need a lawyer-approved version for commercial use, consult an actual lawyer.*
